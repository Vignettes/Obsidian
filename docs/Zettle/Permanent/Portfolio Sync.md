# What is Portfolio Sync?
Like a person the portfolio needs a regular checkup to validate it's progress towards meeting the objectives. 

In [[Measure Portfolio Performance]] the use of metrics by an Agile Portfolio Management Office is outlined. The chosen metrics may be one part of the conversation in these meetings. 

# Potential Topics:
- Reviewing epic implementation
- Status of Key Progress Indicators (KPIs)
- Addressing dependencies 
- Removal of impediments

# Cadence
The meeting is generally held on a monthly cadence, and when appropriate can be replaced by the [[Strategic Portfolio Review]].
