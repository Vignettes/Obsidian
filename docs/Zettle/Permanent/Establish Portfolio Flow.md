# Establish Portfolio Flow
Portfolio flow can be thought of as the management of portfolio epics through their lifecycle. Efficient portfolio flow depends on limiting the number of significantly large initiatives that cut-across teams and ARTs to best match the portfolio's capacity.

Lean Portfolio Management leverages the [[Portfolio Kanban]] to both visualize and limit [[Work-in-Progress (WIP)]], reduce batch sizes, and control the long-term development queues. 

You will need to understand the total capacity of the portfolio to establish flow effectively. 
$Total \ Capacity =\ Capacity \ for \ New \ Development \ + \  Ongoing \ Maintenance \ and \ Support$
