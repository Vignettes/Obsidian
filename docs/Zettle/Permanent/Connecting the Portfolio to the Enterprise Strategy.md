# Why is Connecting the Portfolio to the Enterprise Strategy Important?
Imagine that you're on a Scrum team and you have the goal to deliver a set of features that you know will make hundreds of stakeholders lives easier. You and the other members of the team work for three months to get the features ready for implementation so you can shake hands and call it a job well done.

The three months flew by and both the team and the stakeholders were too busy to connect to talk about the stakeholders vision for the features or get feedback from any type of review.

> [!warning]
> Without regular feedback and alignment to stakeholders a Scrum team runs the risk of delivering **the wrong thing**. That results in upset stakeholders, and a frustrated Scrum team. Now, scale up that lack of feedback and alignment to be at the enterprise level and imagine the frustration.

No crystal ball is required to know that at the end of quarter review, or when the features go into production questions will start flying.

Much the same as Scrum teams depend on that bi-directional flow of feedback and information so too does the portfolio. Your portfolio **must** be linked to the enterprise business strategy by [[Strategic Themes]]  and the portfolio budget.
