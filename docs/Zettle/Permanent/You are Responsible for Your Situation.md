The consequences--including emotions and summarized as situations--tied to the outcomes of decisions and actions are a personal responsibility. We, as humans, have unrestricted autonomy which provides us the ability to make thousands of small and large decisions throughout our days and lives. To accept responsibility for our situations, regardless of the circumstance, means you have control and further autonomy. Avoiding this responsibility is simply relinquishing control of your life to the forces and will of others. 
 
Does this mean you are at fault for the situation? No, we must separate fault as being the result of choices that have already occurred. Fault is past tense, responsibility lies in the present tense. The actions of another individual can impact us negatively, we can blame them and say they are at fault; we can also take responsibility to hold them accountable and change the situation.
