# What Does it Mean to Forecast and Budget Dynamically?
In a Lean-Agile enterprise the methods of handling budgets must be flexible enough to match the way work is performed. For this reason SAFe recommends a Lean approach that does not rely on fixed, long-range budget cycles (think of yearly budgeting), and the fixed-scope expectations that often go with those types of cycles. 

The new approach must include an understanding the historical and forecasted costs associated with each Solution and the forecasted costs of epics introduced. Adjustments to the budgets should be done about every six months, or as-needed if there are many changes within the portfolio.

The budget adjustments are a part of the [[Strategic Portfolio Review]].
