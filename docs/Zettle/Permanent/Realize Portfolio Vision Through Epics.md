# Realize Portfolio Vision Through Epics
In building towards the future state it is likely large initiatives will need to be implemented, these are known as [[Epics]]. 

There are two types of Epics. Ones that deliver business value are known as business epics, and others that advance our architecture and support future needs of the business are enabler epics. These epics are visualized through the [[Portfolio Kanban]]. 

Lean Portfolio Management will need to understand the cost of the epic and have a potential idea on when it will be delivered for decisions related to [[Lean Governance]].
