# What is a Portfolio Vision?
Portfolio Vision is a way to describe the future state of how the [[Value Streams]] and solutions and the synergy they have to achieve the objectives for the portfolio. The way the portfolio vision for both current and future state should be communicated is through two versions of a [[portfolio canvas]]. 

The portfolio canvas is an evolving document--the Lean Portfolio Management function should review (ideally quarterly) and update to align with [[strategic themes]].
