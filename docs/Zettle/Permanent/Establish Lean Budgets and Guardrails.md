# Establish Lean Budgets and Guardrails
Two funding and governance practices that support maintaining the portfolio vision by increasing the throughput of development and financial and alignment of development to organizational need are [[Lean Budgets]]  and [[Guardrails]]. 

Think of Lean Budgets as the sources that provide funding for your value streams, and the Guardrails as being the governance and spending policies and practices that allow the vision to be achieved safely.
