# Enterprise Architecture and the Portfolio Vision
The road to the future state isn't paved without the support of [[Enterprise Architects]] . Unsurprisingly the Enterprise Architects support enterprise architecture--*but how*? They support following architectural principles and principles that enable the continuous evolution of solutions. Often you hear this as, 'designing scalable solutions.' 

## The Role of Enterprise Architects
Enterprise architecture is a **critical** component in [[Strategy and Investment Funding]] because of the far-reaching impacts of the decisions made today. 

The Enterprise Architects facilitate the reuse of existing hardware and software components which have proven patterns across the portfolio. They drive architectural initiatives--also known as [[Enabler Epics]] . 

By fostering the [[Architectural Runway]] and offering [[architectural governance]] they improve the results for our teams, ARTs and enterprise.
