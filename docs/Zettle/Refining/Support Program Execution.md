As Lean-Agile principles become established in your organization the standard responsibilities of a Portfolio Management Office (PMO) can begin to clash with the new way of working. Traditional PMO operation is very centralized, and will create problems with the goal of decentralization if not addressed.

Transitioning to an Agile Portfolio Management Office (APMO) involves leveraging the specialized skills, knowledge, and relationships the PMO members have to move to a new way of working. 

The APMO transitions away from top-down management practices, as Lean Portfolio Management functions enable them to look for ways to support execution across the portfolio. This often comes in the form of establishing objective metrics and reporting towards overall business agility. 

An APMO may also be the sponsor of Communities of Practice for the Release Train Engineers, and Scrum Masters to provide forums that enhance program execution and institutional knowledge.
