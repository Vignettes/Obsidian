We, as humans, have unrestricted autonomy which provides us the ability to make thousands of small and large decisions throughout our days and lives. To accept responsibility for our situations, regardless of the circumstance, means you have control and further autonomy.

No, we must separate fault as being the result of choices that have already occurred. Fault is past tense, responsibility lies in the present tense.

This is achieved through Lean audit and compliance activities. In traditional projects this is often left as one of the last steps in a project, creating many headaches. To overcome this a more continuous approach is required.

Traditional PMO operation is very centralized, and will create problems with the goal of decentralization if not addressed. Transitioning to an Agile Portfolio Management Office (APMO) involves leveraging the specialized skills, knowledge, and relationships the PMO members have to move to a new way of working. The APMO transitions away from top-down management practices, as Lean Portfolio Management functions enable them to look for ways to support execution across the portfolio. This often comes in the form of establishing objective metrics and reporting towards overall business agility. An APMO may also be the sponsor of Communities of Practice for the Release Train Engineers, and Scrum Masters to provide forums that enhance program execution and institutional knowledge.","title":"Support Program Execution"}]}
